Memegenerator

This Memegenerator was built using React as part of the FreeCodeCamp course. It uses an API to fetch popular memes and allows users to customize the text on  top and bottom of the memes.

  The app uses React state to store and update the user's text inputs and selected meme, allowing for a seamless and interactive user experience.
